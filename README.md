# Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction project! This project leverages Machine Learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast stock prices for selected companies. Built using Flask, our application takes historical stock data from the past three months and predicts the stock prices for the upcoming month. Additionally, the project provides a visual representation of the actual versus predicted stock prices, offering valuable insights into the model's performance and accuracy. Whether you're a data scientist, financial analyst, or just curious about stock market trends, this tool aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for stock price prediction.
